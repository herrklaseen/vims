vims
====

My vim setup. Version controlled, because I garbled my .vimrc by accident and had no backup.


## Windows installation

Create a link to ``_winvimrc`` in whatever ``$VIM`` expands to. Call the link ``_vimrc``. By providing a path to ``Vundle#begin()`` you can specify where to install bundles. Closely related to ``rtp``.
