vims
====

My vim setup. Version controlled, because I garbled my .vimrc by accident and had no backup.


## Windows installation

Create a link to _winvimrc in whatever ``$VIM`` expands to. Call the link ``_vimrc``. Vundle will try to install plugins into the ``$HOME\.vim\`` directory, so you need to look into where that variable points.
